# MongoDB

Mongo DB is a document oriented No-SQL Database. It is a non relational database. It is a Schema free database which is based on binary Json format or BSON

It is organised in a group of Dcouments which is also called as Collection

The main difference between SQL and MongoDB is 
 -  Mongodb has collection where as SQL has table
 -  Mongodb has document where as SQL table has row
 -  Mongodb has Field where as SQL table has column
 
 Hence, the structure of MongoDB is like Database >> Collection >> Documents
